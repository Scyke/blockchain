This is the start of my Python/FPGA blockchain project.

The basic idea is that on my laptop, I can create transactions, view the current chain ect, meanwhile my FPGA will actually mine the blocks and send them back to Python via UART-USB. 

I'm using a DE1SOC to "mine" this toy blockchain. I might increase the difficulty to 6 leading zeros.
